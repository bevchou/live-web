      <h3><a name="basics">1. Creating a Web Page</a></h3>

      This page was typed by hand. Anybody can do this, you don't need any
      special "web creation" tools or HTML editors, and the pages you make can be
      viewed from any browser. To see how this page was made, choose
      <b>View Source</b> (or View Page Source, or View Document Source) in your
      browser's menu. A simple web page like this one is just plain text with
      HTML commands (markup) mixed in. HTML commands themselves are plain text.

      <p>

        When you're just learning and want to experiment, you can do everything on
        your PC. Create a new directory ("folder") for your website, and then put
        the web-page files (HTML plus any pictures) in it. Use NotePad or other
        plain-text editor (not word processor) on your PC to create an
        <tt>index.html</tt> file, which you can view locally with your Web browser.
        (You can also use word processors such as Word or WordPad if you save in
        "plain text", "text", "text document", or "text document MS-DOS format".)
        <a href="#install">Later</a> I'll explain how you can install your web site on
        the Internet.

        <p>
          <dl>
            <dt><i>Example for Windows:</i>

            <dd>Move your mouse cursor to the desktop. Right-click,
              choose <i>New</i>, then choose <i>Folder</i>, and a "New Folder" appears,
              with its name highlighted. Type "Web" to change the folder's name to Web
              (or anything else you want). Then
              <i>Start</i>&nbsp;<tt>-&gt;</tt>&nbsp;<i>Run</i> and type "notepad" to
              start NotePad. Now you can create your first Web page.

          </dl>

          <hr>
          <h3><a name="syntax">2. HTML Syntax</a></h3>

          Web pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). HTML has three
          special characters:
          <tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&amp;</tt>, <tt>&gt;</tt>.
          An HTML command is enclosed in <tt>&lt;...&gt;</tt>, for example
          <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>, which is a paragraph separator, or <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt>
          ("begin bold") and <tt>&lt;/b&gt;</tt> ("end bold"). So the following
          HTML text:

          <p>
            <blockquote>
              <pre>
This sentence contains &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.
</pre>
            </blockquote>
            <p>

              produces:

              <p>
                <blockquote>
                  This sentence contains <b>bold</b> text.
                </blockquote>
                <p>

                  A Web page starts with a series of HTML commands, and ends with
                  a few more. The contents go in between:

                  <p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Sample Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000"&gt;
</pre>
                      <p>
                        <i>(Contents go here)</i>
                        <p>
                          <pre>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>

                      The first line (DOCTYPE) specifies which language the page uses; just copy
                      this line<sup><small>1</small></sup>. The next line, <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt>,
                      starts the page, and is matched by the last line, <tt>&lt;/html&gt;</tt>,
                      which closes the page. <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt>, starts the heading, which
                      contains a title to be displayed on the browser's title bar and a
                      declaration of the character set (usually US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1, or UTF-8).
                      <tt>&lt;/head&gt;</tt> closes the heading.

                      <p>

                        The <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> statement starts the body of the document and can
                        contain specifiers for color and other attributes. This one chooses black
                        writing on a white background. The body is closed by
                        <tt>&lt;/body&gt;</tt> statement.

                        <p>

                          As you can see, most HTML commands (but not all!) come in begin-end pairs:
                          <tt>&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</tt>,
                          <tt>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</tt>, etc. The closing part of the command
                          has a slash (<tt>/</tt>) between the <tt>&lt;</tt> and the first letter of
                          the command.

                          <p>


                            Blank lines and line breaks are ignored. The browser automatically "flows"
                            your text into lines and paragraphs that fit in its window. Paragraphs must
                            be separated by <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>. Line breaks can be forced by
                            <tt>&lt;br&gt;</tt>.

                            <p>
                              <dl>
                                <dt><i>Example for Windows:</i>

                                <dd>Use the mouse to copy the HTML above into NotePad. Then save the file
                                  (<i>File</i>&nbsp;<tt>-&gt;</tt>&nbsp;<i>Save&nbsp;As...</i>)
                                  in your Web directory as <tt>index.html</tt>. Suppose your Windows username
                                  is Olga. Then (depending on which version of Windows you have) this might
                                  be:

                                  <p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                      <pre>
<tt>C:\Documents and Settings\Olga\Desktop\Web\index.html</tt>
</pre>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <p>

                                      Now to see your new web page, just double-click on the Web folder and
                                      then double-click on <tt>index.html</tt>.
                              </dl>
                              <p>

                                Now you're ready to start adding "content" to your web page. Go back to
                                NotePad and replace the title and "(Contents go here)" with whatever you
                                want. Any time you want to see the result, use
                                <i>File</i>&nbsp;<tt>-&gt;</tt>&nbsp;<i>Save</i> in NotePad and then
                                click the Reload button on your browser.

                                <p>
